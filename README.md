# At The Mile ModMail

More dev consistency rules to come, but for now:
- Always add doc comments to functions explaining their purpose.
- Sign said doc comments with a @since (semver) and an @author tag.
- All pulls are subject to Lead Developer review before merging - do not force merge.
- Please leverage testing and canary instances where possible, but use isolated DBs and clients on dedicated testing channels.
- This project is subject to NDA - any non-permitted disclosure of the bot's source code or staff functionality is subject to termination.
